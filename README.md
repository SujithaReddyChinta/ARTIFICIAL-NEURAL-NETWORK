Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks in the human brain. ANNs consist of interconnected nodes, or artificial neurons, organized into layers. Information flows through the network from the input layer, through one or more hidden layers, to the output layer. Each connection between neurons has an associated weight that adjusts during training, allowing the network to learn patterns and relationships in the data.

ANNs are capable of learning complex nonlinear relationships and have been successfully applied to various tasks such as classification, regression, pattern recognition, and reinforcement learning. Training an ANN typically involves an iterative process called backpropagation, where errors between predicted and actual outputs are propagated backward through the network to adjust the weights and minimize the error.

Modern ANN architectures include feedforward neural networks (such as Multilayer Perceptrons), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence modeling, and more advanced variants like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

ANNs have shown remarkable success in many domains, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and finance. However, they require large amounts of data for training, extensive computational resources, and careful hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance. Additionally, overfitting and interpretability remain significant challenges in ANN training and deployment.
